### Task Overview:

Build a frontend-only patient registration app using Pglite for data storage. The app should allow users to:

- Register new patients.
- Query records using raw SQL.
- Persist patient data across page refreshes.
- Support usage across multiple tabs (in the same browser) and make sure writes and reads are synchronized.

### Requirements:

- Document each feature as a separate git commit with a clear commit history.
- Provide setup and usage instructions for the repository.
- Deploy your solution to a publicly accessible URL (can use Vercel / Netlify)
- Describe any challenges faced during development.
